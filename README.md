# spacepuppy-unity-framework
A framework of reusable objects with the Unity game engine version 4.x.

This project is intended to be compiled in Visual Studio and then place the compiled dll's into the project.

I usually create a folder Assets/3rdParty/SpaceuppyUnityFramework. The SpacepuppyUnityFramework dll and .mdb go in there (a .pdb will also be generated by unity, this will allow for code stepping when debugging). I then create a folder Assets/3rdParty/SpaceuppyUnityFramework/Editor and place the SpacepuppyUnityFrameworkEditor dll, .mdb, and the Shaders folder and contents there.

You will also want to go to the PlayerSettings and set the Api compatability level to .Net 2.0, and not 2.0 subset.
