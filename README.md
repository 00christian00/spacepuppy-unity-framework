# spacepuppy-unity-framework
A framework of reusable objects with the Unity game engine version 4.x.

This project is intended to be compiled in Visual Studio and then place the compiled dll's into the project. When compiling you will need to ensure you reference the UnityEngine and UnityEditor dll's for your version of unity. I include a version list in the Resources folder for the version of unity I'm currently using.

#Quick Import

In Builds/OpenSource folder is a prebuilt version of the library in its current state. Drag the contents of this folder into a folder anywhere in your project and it'll work out of the box, I prefer the 'Assets/3rdParty/SpacepuppyUnityFramework' folder. The included meta file configures the scripts execution order automatically. Caution, this meta file's guid is what controls the references to scripts in the library, deleting or modifying it will ruin any script references.

#Custom Building

You'll need to create a folder in Assets for the dll's, I personally use Assets/3rdParty/SpaceuppyUnityFramework. The SpacepuppyUnityFramework dll and .pdb go in there (a .mdb will also be generated by unity, this will allow for code stepping when debugging). I then create a folder Assets/3rdParty/SpaceuppyUnityFramework/Editor and place the SpacepuppyUnityFrameworkEditor dll and .pdb there.

You will also want to go to the PlayerSettings and set the Api compatability level to .Net 2.0, and not 2.0 subset.

Next you'll want to set the execution order of 3 classes in the framework. Of course, if you have meta files turned on, you could just include the supplied SpacepuppyUnityFramework.dll.meta file instead (found in the Resources folder, just place in the same folder as the dll). Those 3 classes are:

com.spacepuppy.GameLoopEntry : -32000

com.spacepuppy.Hooks.EarlyExecutionUpdateEventHooks : -31999

com.spacepuppy.Hooks.TardyExecutionUpdateEventHooks : 32000

Lastly, you need to add 2 tags to the tag manager: 'MultiTag' and 'Root'. Once you've done that select the menu dropdown Spacepuppy->Settings->Sync TagData.

Now you're fully set up.

#Future Plans
Soon I plan to upgrade this project to Unity 5. As far as I know I don't really access anything that has been removed from Unity 4 (namely the quick access fields on GameObject and Component), but I haven't actually tested this against Unity 5 yet.

When I do this the project will move forward as Unity 5 only as I have a few classes/methods that mimic Unity 5 behaviour that will be removed.

I'll include one final Unity 4.x build for use, as well as a branch for Unity 4.x users to easily pull and modify themselves.

As unitypackage is still a possibility, but really all it would do is paste the dll's into the folder as described in 'Quick Import', so really, I don't see the need for it.
